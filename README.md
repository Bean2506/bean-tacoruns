- Drop off locations are randomly generated from multiple options to randomize where the drop off areas are.
- Cook tacos and package them into bags ready for delivery.
- Do a "green taco" run which allows you to sell marijuana if you are carrying any when on a delivery.
- Wash dirty money items into cash if you are holding them during the run.
- Cancel the delivery at any time and throw the bag in the trash.
- Easily configurable.
